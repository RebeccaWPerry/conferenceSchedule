This is how I prepped the data for the d3 site:
*** There were some weird cases that were handled by hand, e.g. misspelled sponsors

in ipython --pylab:

run scrapeSessionInfo.py (slow)
run scrapeUnitInfo.py (fast)
run organize.py

output:
variable: rooms
sponsor_info_java
session_info_java


copy "rooms" variable into index.html
copy sponsor_info_java json into index.html
move session_info_java to sessions.json in the same directory as index.html





Details:

scrapeSessinInfo.py
    -sessions, session code and name
    -session_info, letter, number, name, sponsors
    -dumps to session_info.pkl

scrapeUnitInfo.py
    -creates a list of the long names and abbreviatiosn of the units
    -dumps info to unit_info.pkl

organize.py
