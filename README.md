conferenceSchedule
==================

Open source D3 solution for creating your personal itinerary at a megaconference.

I am interested to hear if you adapt this project for another use. Please be in touch!

I am a physics grad student and wanted to learn d3.  I chose to learn on this calendaring tool for APS March Meeting because I attend each year and spend way too much time deciding what sessions to go to.  This interactive visualization of the main conference sessions gives a broad-sweeping overview of the conference and lets a user create an itinerary of interesting sessions.
